      "ANALYSIS:regulations_rag.regulation_chat:assistant to test_user: For a company with a non-resident foreign currency account looking to pay salaries of employees cross-border, the relevant section is B.14(V)(ii), which states that South African entities may remit funds abroad for employment contracts involving non-residents who are employed outside South Africa, provided that the payments are commensurate with the work undertaken. There is no specific documentation listed in the provided sections for this particular scenario beyond the requirement that payments must be commensurate with the work undertaken. Therefore, it is implied that documentation supporting the nature of the employment and the commensurateness of the payments would be required, but the exact documents are not specified in the provided sections.  \n",
