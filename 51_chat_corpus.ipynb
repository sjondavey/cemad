Once Authorised Dealers receive these declarations, they may allow the foreign nationals to conduct their banking like residents, invest or dispose of their foreign assets including subsequent accruals and foreign income without Financial Surveillance Department intervention. They can also manage non-resident or foreign currency accounts with an Authorised Dealer. Moreover, they can transfer funds overseas accumulated during their stay in South Africa, given they can verify the funds' source and ensure the funds are reasonable concerning their income-generating activities in South Africa. These declarations should be kept by Authorised Dealers for five years post the individual's permanent departure for inspections. However, this does not apply to single remittances up to R5 000 per transaction, requiring only the individual's identity proof, and transactions within business relationships capped at R5 000 per transaction daily, up to R25 000 monthly per applicant. The latter necessitates thorough customer due diligence under section 21 of the FIC Act. Despite foreign nationals conducting banking as residents, their interests in local entities are considered non-resident concerning local financial assistance. For exporting personal and household effects, including vehicles, they must be covered by the SARS Customs Declaration. These goods should either be bought with transferable funds or imported into South Africa, with the individual able to provide proof of importation. Lastly, foreign nationals can send abroad capital introduced into South Africa, provided they can verify the funds' original introduction.\n",

Nonetheless, they can acquire loans abroad to finance foreign asset purchases without South African recourse. Residents with authorized foreign assets can invest in South Africa, but if these assets are acquired through an offshore loop structure, the investment must be reported to an Authorised Dealer upon finalization and an annual progress report submitted to the Financial Surveillance Department. Independent auditor confirmation or documentary evidence must verify these transactions to be at arm's length and for a market-related price. After such transactions, the Authorised Dealer should report details like the names of affiliated foreign investors, asset descriptions, target investment company names in South Africa, acquisition dates, and actual foreign currency amounts, including a transaction reference number, to the Financial Surveillance Department. All inward loans from these investors should align with directives in section I.3(B) of the Authorised Dealer Manual.\n",

Authorised Dealers must then report monthly to the Financial Surveillance Department, detailing individual branch information including full names of immigrants, their spouse and dependants, dates of immigration, and dates of birth. New immigrants are required to present documentary evidence to the Authorised Dealer showing that they have been granted permanent residence in South Africa.
