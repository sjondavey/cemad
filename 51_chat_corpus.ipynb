Once Authorised Dealers receive these declarations, they may allow the foreign nationals to conduct their banking like residents, invest or dispose of their foreign assets including subsequent accruals and foreign income without Financial Surveillance Department intervention. They can also manage non-resident or foreign currency accounts with an Authorised Dealer. Moreover, they can transfer funds overseas accumulated during their stay in South Africa, given they can verify the funds' source and ensure the funds are reasonable concerning their income-generating activities in South Africa.

However, this does not apply to single remittances up to R5 000 per transaction, requiring only the individual's identity proof, and transactions within business relationships capped at R5 000 per transaction daily, up to R25 000 monthly per applicant. The latter necessitates thorough customer due diligence under section 21 of the FIC Act. Despite foreign nationals conducting banking as residents, their interests in local entities are considered non-resident concerning local financial assistance. For exporting personal and household effects, including vehicles, they must be covered by the SARS Customs Declaration.
