The government department will then endorse the letter indicating the value of each parcel received in South Africa during the specified period. Once the letter of authority's limit is reached or it expires, it needs to be returned to the issuing Authorised Dealer before a new one can be provided for a subsequent period. For imports of medals, medallions, pendants, and related non-currency items, inquiries should be directed to ITAC.
